# Bayesian Network Classifier

Project for module 3 of Fundamental of AI at University of Bologna

Starting from the analysis of this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/namanmanchanda/entrepreneurial-competency-in-university-students) about entrepreneurial competency in university students, I extract the most important features that can predict whether the student will become an entrepreneur or not and use them in order to define two different models. In the second part of this notebook, I use structure learning algorithms to learn from the dataset a possible network structure and afterwards all the four models use a bayesian estimator in order to infer the probabilities of the variables. In the last part, all the models are tested for the prediction task and the model that performs better is selected and used to perform probabilistic reasoning.
